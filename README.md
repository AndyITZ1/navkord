# NavKORd
## About
NavKORd is an open source Discord bot that provides the convenience of a Korean to English and vice versa dictionary! You can add this bot to your own Discord server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=728971425041612840&permissions=395137182784&scope=bot)! The bot is being written in Python 3+ using discord.py and is still in a WIP (We are looking for help!).
## Features
At the moment these are the only features we have implemented:
* **Dictionary:** `ktoe`, `etok`
* **User:** `stats (optional: @Username)`
* **Misc:** `ping`, `random`, `help`
* The bot also runs in the background and generates a daily question at a fixed time of 12:00 PM EST.
### **TBD**
* **RPG:** Currently for user stats you can gain both gold and experience points! With that there is a plan in place to implement a boss encounter and other RPG features to buy weapons to defeat the boss. (This portioned of the bot is still undetermined, so suggestions are open to the floor for how the game is implemented!).
## Installation
If you plan on self-hosting the bot, this is where you want to look at!
### Initial Bot Requirements
* Runs using Python 3.7.x+ (Original Source Code is ran in Python 3.8.5)
* Runs using a free MongoDB cluster, but can be adjusted to use other form.s of MongoDB (self hosted or through a VPS).
* Runs using Selenium to webscrape data.
